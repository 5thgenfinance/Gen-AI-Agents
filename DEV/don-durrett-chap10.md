## Appendix B: Key Financial Formulas

### Basic Valuation Metrics
```
% Return = (New Value - Old Value) / Old Value × 100
Market Cap = Share Price × Fully Diluted Shares
Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Net Debt
```

### Profitability Analysis
```
EPS (Earnings Per Share) = Net Profit / Shares Outstanding
PE Ratio = Share Price / EPS
Free Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures
Free Cash Flow Multiple = Market Cap / Free Cash Flow
```

### Mining-Specific Valuations
```
Cash Cost Per Ounce = (Operating Costs - By-product Credits) / Ounces Produced
All-In Sustaining Cost = Cash Cost + Sustaining Capex + Corporate G&A
All-In Cost = All-In Sustaining Cost + Depreciation + Taxes + Royaltes and Fees + Finance Charges + Working Capital + Impairments + Reclamation or remediation + Exploration, development and permitting
Resource Valuation = Resource Ounces × Metal Price × 10%
Quick Market Cap Estimate = Resource Ounces × $250 (for gold)
```

### Growth and Development Analysis
```
Future Market Cap (Reserves) = Annual Production × (Future Metal Price - AISC) × Multiple
Future Market Cap Growth = (Future Market Cap - Current Market Cap) / Current Market Cap
NAV Per Share = Net Asset Value / Fully Diluted Shares
```

### Financial Health Metrics
```
Debt Coverage = Free Cash Flow / Net Debt
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities  
Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
Return on Assets = Net Income / Total Assets
```

- Detect impossible or contradictory statements
- Verify all quoted metrics and ratios

### Sycophancy Assessment Criteria
- Excessive use of superlatives without supporting evidence
- Failure to mention obvious risks or challenges
- Overemphasis on positive aspects without balance
- Promotional language inconsistent with factual analysis

## The Enhanced 10-Factor Valuation System

Each factor now includes:
- **Base Score** (1-10): Traditional Durrett scoring
- **Data Quality Adjustment**: Score modification based on source reliability
- **Audit Flags**: Identified issues requiring attention
- **Confidence Level**: Overall reliability of factor assessment

#### Example Enhanced Factor Scoring:
```
Factor 1: Properties/Ownership
Base Score: 8/10
Data Quality Adjustment: -0.5 (secondary source heavy)
Audit Flags: Resource estimate from company website only
Confidence Level: 85%
Final Adjusted Score: 7.5/10
```

## Comprehensive Data Quality Score Calculation

### Overall DQS Formula:
```
DQS = (Accuracy Score × 0.5) + (Hallucination Risk Score × 0.3) + (Sycophancy Risk Score × 0.2)
```

### Risk-Adjusted Investment Score:
```
Final Investment Score = (10-Factor Score × DQS/10) × Confidence Multiplier
```

### Confidence Multiplier Based on Source Mix:
- 90%+ Primary Sources: 1.0
- 70-89% Primary Sources: 0.95
- 50-69% Primary Sources: 0.90
- 30-49% Primary Sources: 0.85
- <30% Primary Sources: 0.75
