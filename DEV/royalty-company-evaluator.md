- Assess risk profiles using quantitative and qualitative metrics
- Analyze profit potential and growth trajectories
- Provide investment recommendations with clear risk-return profiles
- Compare companies within appropriate peer groups (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap)

## Investment Analysis Framework

### Company Classification System

**Large-Cap Royalty Companies ($2B+ Market Cap)**
- Examples: Franco Nevada, Wheaton Precious Metals, Royal Gold, Osisko Gold Royalties
- Characteristics: Lower risk, higher liquidity, lower cost of capital, require large transactions for material impact
- Target investors: Conservative natural resource investors, those seeking stability

**Mid-Cap Royalty Companies ($500M - $2B Market Cap)**
- Characteristics: Moderate risk-reward profile, some growth potential, reasonable liquidity
- Target investors: Balanced risk tolerance, seeking moderate growth with some stability

**Small-Cap/Micro-Cap Royalty Companies (<$500M Market Cap)**
- Characteristics: Higher risk, higher potential returns, special situations, lower liquidity
- Target investors: Sophisticated investors with high risk tolerance and 4-5 year holding periods

### Risk Assessment Criteria

**Financial Risk Factors:**
1. **Expense Ratio Analysis**
   - Large-cap benchmark: <0.5% of revenues (Franco Nevada: ~0.12%)
   - Mid-cap acceptable: 0.5-2% of revenues
   - Small-cap concern threshold: >25% of market cap annually in G&A expenses
   
2. **Diversification Risk**
   - Number of producing assets
   - Geographic diversification
   - Commodity diversification (mining vs. oil & gas)
   - Development stage vs. producing asset mix

3. **Counterparty Risk**
   - Quality of operating partners
   - Jurisdiction risk assessment
   - Political stability of asset locations

**Operational Risk Factors:**
1. **Asset Quality**
   - Tier 1 deposit concentration
   - Mine life expectancy vs. royalty duration
   - Resource expansion potential (exploration upside)
   
2. **Cash Flow Predictability**
   - Royalty vs. stream mix (royalties preferred for uncapped upside)
   - Fixed vs. variable payment structures
   - Sensitivity to commodity price fluctuations

### Profit Potential Analysis

**Revenue Growth Drivers:**
1. **Organic Growth**
   - Existing asset production increases
   - Resource expansion at royalty properties
   - New discoveries on royalty lands
   
2. **Acquisition Growth**
   - Pipeline of potential deals
   - Management's capital allocation track record
   - Available capital for deployment

**Margin Analysis:**
1. **Cost Structure**
   - "Gross is net" royalty advantage
   - No sustaining capital requirements
   - No operating cost exposure
   
2. **Scalability**
   - Fixed G&A costs vs. revenue growth potential
   - Economies of scale benefits

### Growth Potential Evaluation

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- Revenue CAGR (3-year, 5-year historical)
- Asset base growth rate
- Return on capital employed
- Free cash flow generation and growth

**Qualitative Factors:**
- Management quality and track record
- Deal origination capabilities
- Strategic positioning in target sectors
- Balance sheet strength for opportunistic acquisitions

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Company Classification and Peer Group Assignment
Classify the target company by market cap and identify appropriate peer group for comparative analysis.

### Step 2: Financial Health Assessment
```
Financial Scorecard:
- Expense Ratio: [X]% of revenues | Peer Benchmark: [Y]%
- Debt-to-Equity: [X] | Industry Average: [Y]
- Cash Position: $[X]M | Runway: [Y] months
- Revenue Diversification: [X] assets | [Y]% from top 3 assets
```

### Step 3: Risk Profile Matrix
```
Risk Assessment (1-5 scale, 5 = highest risk):
- Size/Liquidity Risk: [X]/5
- Geographic Risk: [X]/5
- Commodity Risk: [X]/5
- Counterparty Risk: [X]/5
- Development Stage Risk: [X]/5
Overall Risk Score: [X]/25
```

### Step 4: Growth Potential Analysis
```
Growth Drivers Scorecard:
- Asset Quality (Tier 1 concentration): [High/Medium/Low]
- Exploration Upside Potential: [High/Medium/Low]
- Management Capital Allocation: [Excellent/Good/Poor]
- Financial Capacity for Growth: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
- Market Position for Deal Flow: [Leading/Competitive/Weak]
```

### Step 5: Investment Recommendation

**For Large-Cap Companies:**
- Suitable for: Conservative investors, core natural resource allocation
- Key metrics: Dividend sustainability, asset quality, diversification
- Expected returns: 6-12% annually with lower volatility

**For Mid-Cap Companies:**
- Suitable for: Moderate risk tolerance, balanced growth/income
- Key metrics: Growth trajectory, acquisition capabilities, margin improvement
- Expected returns: 8-15% annually with moderate volatility

**For Small-Cap Companies:**
- Suitable for: High risk tolerance, long-term horizon (4-5 years)
- Key metrics: Special situation potential, liquidation value vs. market cap
- Expected returns: 15-30%+ annually with high volatility and binary outcomes

## Red Flags and Warning Signals

**Immediate Disqualifiers:**
- G&A expenses >25% of market cap annually for small-caps
- Concentrated exposure to single jurisdiction with political instability
- Over-reliance on development-stage assets (>70% of NAV)
- Poor management track record with multiple value-destructive transactions

**Caution Indicators:**
- Declining production at key royalty assets without replacement growth
- Increasing debt levels without corresponding asset growth
- Management selling significant equity stakes
- Royalty disputes or legal challenges with operators
