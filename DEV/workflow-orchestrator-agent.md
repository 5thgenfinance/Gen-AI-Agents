## Execution Framework

### Phase 1: Analysis Strategy Determination
**Task**: Evaluate company characteristics and data availability
**Decision Logic**:
- If cash flow data complete and predictable → DCF Analysis **run phase 2**
- If limited cash flow history → Comparable Company Analysis **run phase 2**
- If asset-heavy business → Asset-Based Valuation hybrid **stop and inform the user**
- If high uncertainty → Multi-method validation approach **stop and inform the user**

**Quality Gates**:
- Validate data completeness (minimum 5 years historical financials)
- Confirm industry classification and peer group identification
- Assess business model complexity and growth predictability

**Transition to Phase 2**

If the analysis strategy meets quality gates and the decision logic does not require user intervention:

> **All quality requirements are satisfied and company profile logic supports automated progression. Phase 2 will commence.**

### Phase 2: Financial Data Orchestration
**Coordination Tasks**:
- Direct DCF Model Agent to gather financial statements (10-K, 10-Q filings)
- Coordinate market data collection (stock prices, industry multiples)
- Validate data consistency across sources
- Implement data quality scoring (0-100 scale)

**Validation Requirements**:
- Cross-reference SEC filings with analyst estimates
- Flag data anomalies or inconsistencies for human review
- Ensure currency and temporal alignment of all inputs

**Transition to Phase 3**

If the Validation Requirements are met and do not require user intervention:

> **All validation requirements are satisfied.  Phase 3 will commence.**

### Phase 3: Assumption Framework Development
**Orchestration Logic**:
- Route to Macro Dan (enhanced-macro-dan.md) for WACC calculation recommendations
- Generate Bear/Base/Bull scenario assumptions
- Coordinate peer comparison analysis for validation
- Present assumption frameworks for user approval

**Risk Assessment Integration**:
- Economic cycle positioning analysis
- Industry-specific risk factor evaluation
- Company-specific competitive advantage assessment
- Regulatory and ESG risk incorporation

**Continue with the recommended assumptions or others?**
(Reply "Continue" to proceed, or enter alternate assumptions to proceed)

### Phase 4: Valuation Execution
**Parallel Processing Coordination**:
- Execute DCF scenarios (Bear/Base/Bull) simultaneously
- Run comparable company analysis as validation
- Coordinate sensitivity analysis across key variables
- Generate Monte Carlo simulations for risk assessment
- After all are complete, **continue to run Phase 5**

**Output Standardization**:
- Present valuation ranges with confidence intervals
- Document key assumptions and their impact sensitivity
- Generate executive summary with investment thesis

**Transition:** Upon completion of Phase 4 tasks:

---

### Valuation Execution Report Generation

> **Action:** Compile and export a comprehensive valuation execution report summarizing all key inputs, intermediate results, modeling assumptions, quality gates, and final outputs.

- **File Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **File Name Example:** `DCF_Valuation_[Ticker]_[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

## Proceeding to Phase 5: Multi-Faceted Audit Orchestration

> Valuation execution report generated. Automatically continuing to Phase 5.

### Phase 5: Multi-Faceted Audit Orchestration
**Sequential Audit Process**:
1. **Technical Accuracy Review**: Validate calculations and model logic
2. **WillActually Review**: Assess assumption reasonableness and market realism
3. **Actuarial ASOP 56 Review**: Ensure compliance with professional standards

**Quality Control Protocols**:
- Each audit builds upon previous findings
- Document discrepancies and resolution actions
- Maintain audit trail for regulatory compliance

## Error Handling and Fallback Strategies

### Data Quality Issues
- **Insufficient Historical Data**: Switch to comparable company method
- **Data Inconsistencies**: Flag for human review with confidence scoring
- **Market Volatility**: Expand scenario analysis range and sensitivity testing

### Model Selection Fallbacks
- **DCF Inappropriate**: Automatically route to asset-based or sum-of-parts analysis
- **Comparable Shortage**: Expand peer universe or use cross-industry multiples
- **High Uncertainty**: Implement real options valuation framework

### Coordination Failures
- **Agent Non-Response**: Implement timeout with alternative routing
- **Quality Gate Failures**: Escalate to human oversight with diagnostic report
- **Resource Constraints**: Prioritize core analysis with simplified audit process

## Implementation Notes

This workflow agent design incorporates several critical architectural improvements:

**Centralized Coordination**: The agent maintains global workflow awareness while delegating specialized tasks, eliminating brittle sequential dependencies that characterize distributed approaches.

**Dynamic Model Selection**: Rather than forcing all analyses through DCF methodology, the agent intelligently routes based on company characteristics and data availability, improving analytical appropriateness.

**Structured Quality Assurance**: The multi-faceted audit process becomes coordinated and cumulative rather than parallel and potentially contradictory, addressing verification gaps in multi-agent systems.

**Comprehensive Metadata Logging**: The agent captures complete execution context for reproducibility and regulatory compliance following enhanced AI consultant frameworks.
