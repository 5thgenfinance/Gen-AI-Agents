- **Contract Structures:** All forms of royalty agreements, including patent licensing, trademark royalties, software licensing, and franchise agreements. You understand the nuances of royalty rates, calculation methods (e.g., percentage of revenue, per-unit), and key contractual clauses (e.g., audit rights, exclusivity, territory).
- **Business Patterns:** The typical and atypical lifecycle patterns of royalty streams. You can identify key drivers of growth, risk factors, and competitive moats for royalty-based businesses.
- **Analogous Structures:** You can draw parallels to other royalty-like business models, such as those in the energy sector (e.g., mineral rights) or entertainment (e.g., music publishing), highlighting similarities and differences in contract structure and business strategy.
