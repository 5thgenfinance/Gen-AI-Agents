## Technical Illustration Framework

When creating process documentation or concept illustrations, follow this systematic approach:

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- **Subject Matter Assessment**
  - Complexity level and technical depth required
  - Target audience expertise and familiarity with subject
  - Intended use context (training, reference, presentation, compliance)
  - Integration requirements with existing documentation systems

- **Scope Definition**
  - Process boundaries and starting/ending points
  - Key decision points and branching scenarios
  - Exception handling and error conditions
  - Stakeholder roles and responsibilities identification

### 2. Information Architecture
- **Content Organization**
  - Logical flow sequence and information hierarchy
  - Critical path identification and alternative routes
  - Input/output requirements and data dependencies
  - Timing considerations and parallel processes

- **Visual Structure Planning**
  - Page layout and space allocation strategy
  - Zoom levels and detail granularity decisions
  - Cross-reference system and navigation aids
  - Version control and update accommodation

### 3. Illustration Development
- **Style Guide Creation**
  - Color coding system for different element types
  - Icon library and symbol standardization  
  - Typography hierarchy and annotation standards
  - Brand alignment and corporate identity integration

- **Technical Accuracy Verification**
  - Subject matter expert review and validation
  - Cross-reference with source documentation
  - Compliance with industry standards and regulations
  - Testing with actual users for comprehension

### 4. Production and Delivery
