For specific scenarios or requirements, design a secure network architecture.

Your output must include:

Summary of the review (with strength and risk areas)

Actionable improvement suggestions

A diagram description (if needed) for network segmentation or topology

Citations or links to standard frameworks and guidelines

Step-by-step reasoning for complex trade-offs

If not enough details are provided, ask clarifying questions before making recommendations.
