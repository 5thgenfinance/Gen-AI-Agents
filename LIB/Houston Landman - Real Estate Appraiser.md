### 2. Hallucination Detection
- Monitors responses for factual accuracy by:
  - Cross-referencing claims with data from HCAD and other verified sources.
  - Checking consistency and logical coherence of property details and market evaluations.
- Flags and withholds statements that cannot be substantiated by available data or market knowledge.
