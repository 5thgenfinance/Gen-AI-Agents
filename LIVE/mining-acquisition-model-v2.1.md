## Model Architecture

### Time Horizon
**18 months forward**

### Assessment Frequency
**Monthly recalibration**

### Output Format
For each target company:
1. **Takeout Likelihood** (Very High / High / Medium / Low) with heat icon
2. **Expected Premium Range** (e.g., 22-30%)
3. **Why Takeout is Imminent** (bulleted catalysts)
4. **What Could Delay** (bulleted risks)
5. **Most Likely Acquirer(s)** with probability rankings

## Part 1: Takeout Likelihood Heat Scale

| Likelihood Rating | Heat Icon | Color | Probability Band | Description |
|-------------------|-----------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **Very High** | üî¥üî• | Red/Hot | 85-95% | Almost all factors present; deal imminent barring rare events |
| **High** | üü†üî• | Orange/Warm | 70-84% | Most factors present; deal likely but not certain |
| **Medium** | üü° | Yellow/Moderate | 55-69% | Some factors present; plausible but uncertain |
| **Low** | üîµ‚ùÑÔ∏è | Light Blue/Cool | <55% | Few factors; unlikely barring major change |

**Key Principle:** Likelihood ratings are based on **convergence of model factors**, not mathematical precision. "Very High" requires 6-7 major drivers simultaneously present.

## Part 2: Core Probability Factors (Weighted)

### 1. Financial Health (Weight: 25%)

**Cash Position Metrics:**
- Cash-to-Market Cap Ratio: >20% = high urgency trigger
- Burn Rate Analysis: Monthly cash consumption vs. runway
- **Financing Runway:** <12 months = board fiduciary duty threshold
- Debt-to-Assets Ratio: <10% preferred

**Scoring Thresholds:**
- 90-100: Cash runway >24 months, no debt
- 75-89: Cash runway 12-24 months, minimal debt
- 60-74: Cash runway 6-12 months, moderate debt
- **40-59: Cash runway <6 months (distressed signal)**
- <40: Imminent financing need, survival risk

**Distress Signals:**
- 3+ financings in 12 months
- Royalty/stream sales (4-5% NSR typical)
- Insider selling despite low prices

### 2. Resource Quality and Project Economics (Weight: 30%)

**Grade and Scale:**
- Resource size (M&I ounces/pounds)
- Grade percentile vs peer group
- All-in sustaining costs (AISC) quartile

**Project Maturity Stage Multipliers (v2.1 Calibrated):**

```python
stage_multipliers = {
    'Producer - Cash Flow Positive': 0.90,   # Lower growth, steady value
    'Producer - Ramp-Up': 1.10,              # Near-peak value
    'Construction - Funded': 1.15,            # Clear path to production
    'FS Complete': 1.20,                      # De-risked, high certainty
    'PFS Stage': 1.10,                        # Moderate confidence
    'PEA Stage': 1.05,                        # Early-stage discount

    'Exploration - Early Stage': 0.85,        # High uncertainty
    'Royalty/Streaming - Producing': 0.95,    # Cash flow stability
    'Major - Integrated': 0.90                # Complexity discount
}
```

**Backtest Validation:**
- **FS Complete:** Northern Superior (PEA) predicted 33.6%, actual 35% (1.4 pp error) ‚úì
- **Producer:** SilverCrest predicted 22.6%, actual 21% (1.6 pp error) ‚úì

## Part 3: Premium Calculation Formula (v2.1 Calibrated)

### Base Formula

```
Premium_Expected = Base_Premium √ó Commodity_Factor √ó Size_Factor √ó 
                   Cycle_Multiplier √ó Jurisdiction_Factor √ó Stage_Multiplier
```

### 1. Base Premium (Oct 2025)

**Historical Sector Medians:**
- 2020-2021: 19% (recovery, cautious)
- 2022-2023: 24% (rising commodities)
- 2024-2025: **23%** (sustained strength)

**Current Base Premium: 23%**

---

### 2. Commodity-Specific Factors (v2.1 Calibrated)

**Premium Multipliers by Metal/Asset Class:**

```python
commodity_factors = {
    # Uranium (Supply Scarcity Premium)
    'Uranium - Developer': 1.45,      # Calibrated from Paladin/Fission
    'Uranium - Producer': 1.20,       # Producing assets, lower risk
    'Uranium - ISR': 0.95,            # ISR-specific (lower premium)
    
    # Copper (Energy Transition Premium)
    'Copper - Developer': 1.25,       
    'Copper - Producer': 0.85,        
    'Copper/Nickel': 1.10,            
    
    # Gold (Traditional Premium)
    'Gold - Developer': 1.10,         # Calibrated down from 1.20
    'Gold - Producer': 0.85,          
    'Gold - Major': 0.85,             # Increased from 0.75
    
    # Silver (Consolidation Premium)
    'Silver - Producer': 0.95,        
    'Silver - Developer': 1.10,       
    
    # Multi-Commodity
    'Gold/Silver - Multi': 1.05,      
}
```

---

### 3. Deal Size Scaling Factors

```python
def size_factor(deal_value_usd_m):
    if deal_value_usd_m < 500:
        return 1.10  # Small-cap volatility premium
    elif 500 <= deal_value_usd_m < 2000:
        return 1.05  # Mid-tier standard
    elif 2000 <= deal_value_usd_m < 5000:
        return 1.00  # Large-cap baseline
    elif 5000 <= deal_value_usd_m < 10000:
        return 0.90  # Mega-deal discount
    else:  # >$10B
        return 0.85  # Complexity discount (softened from 0.78)
```

**Rationale:**
- Small deals (<$500M): Competitive bidding among mid-tiers
- Mega-deals (>$10B): Limited buyer pool, regulatory scrutiny
- v2.1 softened discount based on Newcrest/Newmont actual (17% vs predicted 14%)

---

### 4. Market Cycle Multipliers

```python
cycle_multipliers = {
    'Hot Cycle (2024-2025)': 1.15,      # Active bidding, high liquidity
    'Moderate Cycle': 1.05,             # Steady activity
    'Neutral': 1.00,                    # Baseline
    'Cooling': 0.90                     # Cautious
}
```

**Current Status (Oct 2025): Hot Cycle = 1.15√ó**

---

## Part 4: Confidence Intervals & Risk Bands

### Premium Uncertainty Bands

```python
confidence_intervals = {
    'High Confidence (¬±5%)': [
        'Producer - stable cash flow',
        'Tier 1 jurisdiction',
        'Clear strategic fit',
        'Single bidder likely'
    ],
    
    'Moderate Confidence (¬±8%)': [
        'Developer - PFS/FS stage',
        'Tier 2 jurisdiction',
        'Multiple potential bidders',
        'Mid-cap deal size'
    ],
    
    'Low Confidence (¬±12%)': [
        'Explorer - early stage',
        'Tier 3 jurisdiction',
        'Competitive bidding expected',
        'Small-cap volatility'
    ]
}
```

**Application:** Report premium as range, not point estimate

**Example:**
- Base prediction: 30%
- Confidence: Moderate (¬±8%)
- **Reported Range: 22-38%**

---

## Part 5: Special Cases & Adjustments

### Bidding War Premium Boost
**If competitive bidding detected (multiple LOIs, hostile bids):**
- Add +10-15% to base premium

### Distressed Sale Discount
**If financial distress evident (runway <6 months, covenant breach):**
- Subtract -5-10% from base premium (but raises urgency)

### Strategic Synergy Premium
**If acquirer has adjacent operations (<20km):**
- Add +5-8% for infrastructure synergy

### Hostile Takeover Premium
**If unsolicited/hostile bid:**
- Add +12-18% for control premium

### High Insider Ownership Premium
**If >40% insider ownership AND willing sellers:**
- Add +10-15% control premium
**If >40% insider ownership AND unwilling:**
- Likelihood ‚Üí Low (deal blocked)

---

## Part 6: Acquirer Probability Benchmarking

### Scoring Framework for Potential Acquirers

**Factors (Weighted):**
- Strategic Fit (30%): Asset type, geography, operational synergy
- Balance Sheet Capacity (25%): Cash, debt capacity, M&A track record
- Geographic Synergy (20%): Adjacent operations, jurisdiction presence
- Prior M&A Activity (25%): Recent deals, stated growth strategy

**Scoring Scale:**
- 90-100: Very High Probability (>80% chance)
- 80-89: High Probability (60-80%)
- 70-79: Moderate Probability (40-60%)
- 60-69: Low Probability (20-40%)
- <60: Very Low Probability (<20%)

**Example Output:**
