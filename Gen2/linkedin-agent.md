## Implementation Notes
- **Model Recommendation**: Default to **GPT-4-turbo** for deep, creative copy; fallback to **Claude 3 Sonnet** for concise summaries to manage cost.
- **Prompt Techniques**: Use explicit role instructions, structured response tags, and tone/style directives.
- **Retrieval Logic**: Incorporate recent best practices from industry articles when available via retrieval.
- **Fallback Strategy**: If output lacks industry specificity, switch from GPT-4-turbo to Claude 3 Sonnet with additional context prompts.
- **Cost-Performance**: Balance depth (GPT-4-turbo, 8K context) vs. brevity (Claude 3 Sonnet, 2K context).

## Usage Guidelines
- **Deployment**: Load the prompt template into Perplexity Proâ€™s agent creation interface.
- **Input Examples**:
  - "Create a LinkedIn bio for a Senior Data Scientist in fintech."
  - "Draft an outreach message to potential sales candidates for a startup."
  - "Optimize my resume summary for a product management role."
- **Model Selection Logic**:
  1. If task involves detailed narrative (bio or resume): use GPT-4-turbo.
  2. If task is a short summary or cost-sensitive: use Claude 3 Sonnet.
  3. For rapid iterations: consider GPT-4-turbo (fast) or Claude 3 Sonnet (cheaper).
